# When Did The Son of God Take On Flesh?

Elsewhere people have written about [the biblical evidence that humans are considered as a person from the moment of conception](http://crossway.org). Others have written about the scientific and philosophical nature of conception, and have attempted to demonstrate from this that life and personhood must begin at conception. This is a small attempt to make a christological argument for “life” beginning at conception. By this I mean, that the nature of Christ taking on flesh demonstrates that for all humans, a new individual person begins at conception.

It’s a settled matter of Christian doctrine that the true God is the Trinitarian God. He is the one whom has always existed, and without who nothing that exists has come into existence. This God is eternally Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. There never was a time where the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit, was not. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” (John 1:1)  writes the apostle John. And then, around AD zero “the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.” (John 1:14). The eternal Son of God came into the world as a true, genuine, bona-fide human.
 
One question the church wrestled with (like the doctrine of the trinity) was at what point did the Son of God become human? Did the Son hijack a human body at His baptism? Did He turf out an existing human being or perhaps unite himself with the human already there? Or was it at his birth? Or some other period? Just as they did with the doctrine of the trinity the church also came to a settled conclusion on the matter. The bible teaches that the Son of God became human at conception.

Luke tells us that when Mary asked how she, a virgin, would have a baby an angel replied “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God” (Luke 1:35) Matthew tells us that Mary “was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 1:18). Joseph was told that “what is conceived in [Mary] is from the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 1:20). The Holy Spirit does the work that brings the Son of God into human flesh, and He does it at Jesus’ conception.^[1](#fn1)^

Consider the word overshadow in Luke 1:35. The word ἐπισκιάζω __episkiazō__ doesn’t appear often in Greek. In the gospels the only place else it appears is when the bright cloud of the divine presence over shadows Jesus and his disciples at the transfiguration. It’s also the word in the Greek translation of the Old Testament for when the cloud comes down on the tabernacle and the glory of the LORD filled it and made his presence know. Here is God appearing in person.^[2](#fn2)^

You could argue at this point that the Holy Spirit merely is making a unique, curse-of-sin-free, human embryo, and it’s only later that this unborn baby is united with the divine nature of the Son. But I think this is a very unnatural reading of those annunciation passages quoted. The Holy Spirit isn’t making a vessel for the Son to pop into later on, but He is doing the work of bringing the Son of God into the world as flesh. “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and then 3-9 months later come upon you again to finish the job” is not the word of the lord. I also think this view would destroy the incarnation. If Christ doesn’t experience all of humanity, including the first nine months in the womb, he’s not a normal human, but a different one who has just borrowed flesh temporarily. His humanity would be an outfit He wears not something He becomes. But the Son of God becomes a real human at conception. This is what the council of Chalcedon in A.D. 451 affirmed. “At once complete in Godhead and complete in manhood”.

This understanding probably makes most sense of why John the Baptist (in the womb) rejoices at the presence of Mary. I will be cautious here. Luke 1 does not say directly John the Baptist leapt in Elizabeth’s womb because he encountered the Son of God in Mary’s womb. It says that John leapt when Elizabeth hears Mary’s greetings. So theoretically he could be leaping at meeting the mother of the Son of God. But why rejoice at the one who will in the future bear the child though she’s not bearing him now? Is it not more likely that he is rejoicing because in her womb is the Son of God? That however far along Mary is (and she won’t be far as this point), John is acknowledging that the Son of God is here, in the body of Mary, being fed and carried and comforted by her.

Some will say, in what way can an embryo also be the Son of God? How can a foetus also contain the fullness of deity? The answer to this is to say how can a baby in a manger also contain these things? Or a boy at the onset of puberty in the temple? Or a thirty-three year old man? There is no more challenge for an embryo to be the Son of God than an adult human.

Another argument that could be raised is to say that Jesus was unique because he pre-existed his human conception, unlike every other human, who came into existence at conception. The premises of this argument are true, but the conclusion that we therefore can’t draw any comparisons isn’t true. If people don’t become people at conception but at a later period of the pregnancy, then christ would also have become human at that period of pregnancy.

## So what?

The bible holds that Christ Jesus wasn’t a different kind of human than everyone else, but rather a human who is perfect. He’s not Human 2.0 but rather Human in perfection. It’s every other member of humanity who has fallen short of true humanity, whose lives are riddling with faults and a buggy mess.  This means Jesus exists as a perfect model of what it means to be a human. Which means that if the Son of God became human at conception, so also all humans become humans at conception. It is conception that is the dawning of a new person, the beginning of a new life. 

This has obvious implications for how we consider life in the womb. For just as from the moment of conception the cells in Mary’s body were the Son of God become man, so from the moment of conception the cells in any woman’s body become a human being. A real actual person. At what point did the son of god become a human? The same point that you or I or anyone else does, at the moment of conception.

## Final Thoughts

This is a particularly Christian argument for life beginning at conception. I don’t expect it to change the minds of anyone who doesn’t follow Jesus Christ. But for those who do believe in Him and have wondered if there really is a biblical rational for believing life begins at conception, I hope this helps you have more confidence that it does.

There are obviously applications to this to those who grieve miscarriage (In the UK where healthcare is good, [around 1 in 5 pregnancies end in miscarriage](https://www.tommys.org/baby-loss-support/miscarriage-information-and-support/miscarriage-statistics). That child who died was a real person, with real humanity. The grief felt is real. There are obvious other applications to how we see abortion. So much of the debate about rights and about healthcare ultimately come down to whether the collection of fertilised cells in a womb’s womb is a person or no
